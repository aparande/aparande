### Hello ðŸ‘‹!

Iâ€™m currently a Flight Software Engineer at [Astranis](astranis.com) writing software for our MicroGEO Satellites. 

In my free time, I love to 
- Hack together cool projects. You can see a bunch of them on GitHub below.
- Publish articles on [Medium about tech and public policy](blog.anmolparande.com)

You can learn more about what I've worked on my [personal website](anmolparande.com) or you can reach out via [email](mailto:parande.anmol@gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/parandea1_7).
