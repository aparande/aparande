### Hello ðŸ‘‹!

Iâ€™m currently a Masters Student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. My focus is on signal processing and machine learning.

- I love to hack together projects in my spare time. You can see a bunch of them on GitHub below.
- I publish articles on [Medium about tech and public policy](blog.anmolparande.com)

You can learn more about what I've worked on my [personal website](anmolparande.com) or you can reach out via [email](mailto:parande.anmol@gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/parandea1_7).
